4) The Workforce Contribution Monitor 
Story 
In the modern remote or hybrid workplace, visibility is no longer synonymous 
with productivity. Engineering and product teams work in complex, 
interconnected webs for communication (Ex: Slack, Teams) and execution (Ex: 
Jira, GitHub). Managers often rely on who speaks up most in stand-ups, who is 
online the longest, or who has the highest number of Git commits to determine 
performance ratings. This creates an illusion where an employee is highly 
active in public channels, constantly tagging management, and creating the 
illusion of leadership. However, their actual output might be minimal, or they 
act merely as a router, passing work to others without adding value. When 
performance review season arrives the Manager often biases toward the loud 
and active one whilst the actual silent architects feel undervalued. 
Objectives: 
Bridge the "Activity vs. Impact" Gap: 
Develop a system that correlates data from Communication Platforms (If any) 
with Execution Platforms (GitHub). 
Define Your Own "True Contribution" Metrics:  
Derive a set of metrics or a scoring algorithm that weighs the quality of work 
over the quantity of artifacts. How do you value a critical bug fix vs. a feature 
launch? How do you value a mentor vs. a coder? 
Actionable Visibility:  
Transform raw logs into a manager-friendly dashboard that highlights the 
"Silent Architects" those contributing high value with low visibility ensuring 
they are not overlooked during performance reviews. 
The Core Outcome  
A Manager’s dashboard to monitor his/her team or multiple teams. A visual 
interface that allows a manager to monitor a single team or multiple squads.
